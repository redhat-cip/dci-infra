# Organization

The ecosystem of Distributed CI (DCI) relies on several components. Some are developed by the DCI team while others are well known software. DCI relies only on packaged softwares for the platform we support.

## Components

The 'core' components provided by the DCI team itself are:

 * **dci-control-server**: The API (a.k.a the Control-Server). This is where all the logic happens.
 * **dci-ui**: The DCI web interface code.
 * **python-dciclient**: This code hosts the client library and CLI to interact with the dci-api.
 * **dci-agents**: Various agents to provide integration functionality.
 * **dci-feeders**: Various feeders that will create components on the server.

**Note**: For the packages `dci-agents` and `dci-feeders` the code itself is stored in the `python-dciclient` repository.

## Release Cycle

DCI follows a Continuous Deployment (CD) pattern for its own production needs.

What this means is that as soon as a patch is merged on our code base, a package is built, tested, and shipped to our repositories. Through the continous deployment methodology, our users can always benefit from the shiniest and brightest features the last contribution brought to the code.

For those of who prefer not to live on the edge, the DCI team also provides regularly tagged release versions.

## Repositories

To provide the aforementioned packages, the DCI team provide a set of repositories.

There are three repositories:

 * **Current**: This repository contains the tagged release versions. They might be behind the master branch but those versions are stable and receive bug-fixes and security backports.
 * **Development**: This repository contains the version of the package built after each commit upstream has been tested and merged. As stated earlier, this repository always contains the latest changes to the system.
 * **Extras**: For components that we would like to ship, but are not yet packaged upstream, we provide the packages necessary in the Extras repository. **Note**: Please verify the content of this repository before pulling any packages since it can potentially update your locally installed version.

Packages are available at <https://packages.distributed-ci.io/repos/>

The DCI team provides the `dci-release` package that will create the repository file locally for you.

The `dci-release` package is located at <https://packages.distributed-ci.io/> for CentOS 7, Fedora 22, and Fedora 23. The package name is `dci-release.XXX.noarch.rpm` where `XXX` should be replaced with one of `el7`, `fc22`, or `fc23`.

## Upstream

The source code for various DCI components is hosted on [Software Factory](http://softwarefactory-project.io/), and mirrors are provided on GitHub at the following locations. To contribute to DCI, you'll need to clone from Gerrit on the [Software Factory](http://softwarefactory-project.io/) site.

Each of those git repositories are also mirrored in GitHub, under the [redhat-cip](https://github.com/redhat-cip) namespace.
