# Preferred Installation

There are a few ways to install the DCI Control-Server, but the preferred and documented method is to utilize the DevOps tools available.

## dci-infra

The DCI team provides an [ansible playbook](https://www.ansible.com) to automate the install of the DCI Control-Server in a repository called [dci-infra](https://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-infra).

It should not be necessary to change anything in the `dci-infra` repository. A complementary repository where your local override data should live is contained within the [dci-infra-data-quickstart](https://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-infra-data-quickstart) repository.

If you find an area that can be made more dynamic in the `dci-infra` repository, or you find a bug, please feel free to submit a ticket or pull request on the [Github](https://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-infra/issues) tracker.

## dci-infra-data-quickstart

[dci-infra-data-quickstart](https://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-infra-data-quickstart) is where all your custom modifications should live.

The [dci-infra](https://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-infra) repository provides all the installation logic and orchestration. It installs packages, edits configuration files, and starts services. The values necessary for the configuration files are read from the [dci-infra-data-quickstart](https://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-infra-data-quickstart) project.

The [dci-infra-data-quickstart](https://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-infra-data-quickstart) can be seen as a deployed environment, with each clone/branch of this project being a different environment.

To get started, simply clone the [dci-infra-data-quickstart](https://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-infra-data-quickstart) repository, amend the `group_vars/all` file (and create a `vhost_vars/X` file if necessary) to match your infrastructure.

After modifying the configuration, the workflow continues as follows:

> 1.  Clone [dci-infra](https://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-infra)
> 2.  Clone `dci-infra-data-quickstart` into a `data/` directory in your `dci-infra` directory
> 3.  Install the necessary ansibles modules by running `ansible-galaxy install -r installed_roles -p roles/`
> 4.  Run the installer `ansible-playbook -i data/hosts playbook.yml --tags dci-core`

In summary it should look like:

``` sourceCode
#> git clone https://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-infra
#> cd dci-infra
#> git clone https://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-infra-data-quickstart data
#> ansible-galaxy install -r installed_roles -p roles/
#> ansible-playbook -i data/hosts playbook.yml --tags dci-core
```

At the end you should have a succesful deployment of a DCI Control-Server.

If you are provisioning a Fedora 23 server make sure the `python2`,

> `yum` and `gnupg` packages are installed, otherwise Ansible won't work.

If your DNS setup is correct, you can log in the value of the `ui_servername` variable, with the Login field value being `admin`, and the Password field value being the contents of the `admin_password` variable.

The full list of configuration variables is available in the [configuration variables](http://docs.distributed-ci.io/installation/configuration-variables.html) section.

## Test suite

To ensure the deployed platform is actually working fine, the DCI team provides a functional test suite to be run.

Those tests are run with the use of the `dcictl` command to interact with the server, hence you will need `python-dciclient` to be installed on your machine.

To run the test, from within the the `dci-infra/` directory run `rake -T`, a list of available tests will appear. Feel free to run all of them, as all tests should pass to have a valid deployment.

The parameters used for the functional test suite are located in `dci-infra-data-quickstart/properties.yml`

To be able to run those tests you need a specific set of packages:

 * **From yum**: `python2-dciclient`, `dci-agents`, `python-tox` (found in EPEL for CentOS 7), `rubygems`, `ruby-devel` (on Fedora 23 `python3-dciclient` and `redhat-rpm-config`)
 * **From gem**: rake, ansible\_spec

The test suite should not be run as root
